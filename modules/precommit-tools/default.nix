# Pre-commit Hook Tools Module
#
# Provides a comprehensive set of pre-commit tools organized into logical groups:
# - Format & Style: Code formatting and style enforcement
# - Lint & Analysis: Code quality and pattern checking
# - Content Quality: Documentation and link validation (includes lychee)
# - Security: Security-focused checks
#
# These tools run via .pre-commit-config.yaml during git commit.
# Installation: `pre-commit install` (handled by core.hooksPath in git config)
# Manual run: `pre-commit run --all-files`
#
# This module is a single source of truth for all pre-commit tooling,
# consolidating definitions that previously lived in multiple locations.
#
# Usage:
#   This module exports tool definitions as reference material.
#   Tools are installed via home-manager in the main home.nix configuration.

{ lib, pkgs, ... }:

# Export tool definitions and metadata as a reference library
{
  # Tool definitions organized by purpose/group
  # Used by .pre-commit-config.yaml and documentation
