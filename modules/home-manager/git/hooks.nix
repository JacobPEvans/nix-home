# Git Hooks (Global via core.hooksPath)
#
# These hooks apply to ALL git repos via core.hooksPath (set in common.nix).
# They delegate to pre-commit framework if .pre-commit-config.yaml exists.
#
# Layer 1 of 3-layer defense:
#   1. Global hooks (this) - fast local feedback on ALL repos
#   2. AI deny list - blocks --no-verify bypass attempts
#   3. GitHub branch protection - server-side guarantee
